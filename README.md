COLLECTION: the app for the fashionista

Collection is a simple and functional app to post your favorite images and video from the fashion industry. Built in Ruby on Rails, it's based in the well-known MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller), using templates. 

USERS STORIES: what inspires this app
- "As a user, I will like to get an app to upload images and videos from the fashion events."
- "As a user, I want an app that will let me submit comments about my images and videos from the fashion industry."
- "As a user I want a page to enter my user details."
- "As a user I want an app to manage my images and information about fashion." 

DEVELOPMENT
- Collection runs through 2 models, one for the user and another one for the events (images, videos, comments that the user will upload).
