>An app to upload fashion images, videos and info.

Collection is a simple and functional app to post your favorite images and video from the fashion industry. Built in Ruby on Rails, it's based in the well-known MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller), using templates. 

USERS STORIES: what inspires this app
- "As a user, I will like to get an app to upload images and videos from the fashion events."
- "As a user, I want an app that will let me submit comments about my images and videos from the fashion industry."
- "As a user I want a page to enter my user details."
- "As a user I want an app to manage my images and information about fashion." 

DEVELOPMENT
- Collection runs through 2 models, one for the user and the other one for the events (images, videos and comments that the user will upload). In this case, the relationship in this app is between the user and the events or in a phrase, it can be explained as each "user has many events." 
- Through the use of ruby gems, the app can have a good level of security online. 

RESOURCES
- Ruby on rails templates
- Ruby Gems
- Embedded ruby inside of html
